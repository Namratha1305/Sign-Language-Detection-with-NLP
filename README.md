**Real-Time Sign Language Recognition and Next-Word Prediction**

This project is an interactive application that uses computer vision and natural language processing to recognize sign language gestures in real-time and suggest the next likely words, creating a seamless communication tool. The app features a chat-style interface where users can compose messages by performing signs and selecting from AI-powered suggestions.

🌟 Features
Real-Time Sign Recognition: Recognizes a vocabulary of custom-trained signs directly from a webcam feed.

Intelligent Word Suggestions: An LSTM-based NLP model predicts and suggests the next three most likely words to follow the recognized sign.

Interactive Chat Interface: A user-friendly GUI with a live video feed and a chat window to compose messages.

Automatic Motion Detection: The app intelligently waits for the user to start signing, automatically triggering the recording and prediction process without any key presses.

Dynamic UI: Features a smarter cooldown logic that resets instantly after a sign, making the conversation flow faster.

Chat Functionality: Includes a "Send" button, "Enter" key functionality to send messages, and a "Copy to Clipboard" button.

💻 Technology Stack
Python: The core programming language.

OpenCV: For real-time video capture and image processing.

MediaPipe: For high-fidelity hand and landmark tracking.

TensorFlow / Keras: For building and training the two deep learning models (LSTM networks).

Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).

NumPy: For numerical operations and data handling.

Pillow (PIL): For integrating OpenCV video frames into the Tkinter GUI.

🤔 How It Works
The application's intelligence comes from two separate and specialized neural networks working in tandem:

The Vision Model (The "Eyes" 👀): A recurrent neural network (LSTM) trained on sequences of 3D hand landmark data. Its only job is to watch the user's hand movements and classify them into a known sign (e.g., 'hello', 'i_am').

The Language Model (The "Brain" 🧠): A second LSTM network trained on a text corpus. Its only job is to take a word or phrase as input and predict the most statistically likely words to follow, based on the patterns it learned from the text.

The main application acts as a coordinator, taking the word output from the Vision Model and feeding it as input to the Language Model to generate the final suggestions.

🛠️ Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

Create and activate a virtual environment:

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ How to Use
Train the Models (First-time setup):

To train the sign language model, run data_collector.py to gather your sign data, then run train_sign_model.py.

The word predictor model trains automatically the first time you run the main app.

Launch the Application:

python chat_app.py

Using the App:

The app will display "WAITING FOR SIGN".

Make a clear, deliberate sign in front of the camera. The app will automatically detect the motion and change its status to "RECORDING...".

Once the sign is recognized, the word will be added to the text box, and suggestions will appear.

Hold your hand still or move it out of frame to reset the app for the next sign.

Use the chat interface to build your message and click "Send" or press "Enter".

GitHub Repository Files
Here is what you should put in your GitHub repository.

✅ Files to Upload:
chat_app.py: The main, final application. This is the most important file.

data_collector.py: The script for collecting new sign data.

train_sign_model.py: The script for training the sign recognition model.

large_text_corpus.txt: The text file used to train your word suggester. It's good practice to include the data you used.

requirements.txt: This is a crucial file that lists all the libraries your project needs. You can create it by running this command in your activated virtual environment:

pip freeze > requirements.txt

README.md: The file I just created for you.

Your Trained Models:

best_sign_model.keras

word_predictor.keras

word_tokenizer.pkl

max_sequence_len.pkl

Important: It's a good idea to put these model files into a separate folder (e.g., models/) to keep your repository clean.
 model).

__pycache__/ folders: These are temporary folders created by Python. They should also be added to your .gitignore file.
